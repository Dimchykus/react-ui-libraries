| Performance                | Lightweight and performs well out of the box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Extensive component library may impact initial load times. 3rd level imports is not recommended (suggest to add eslint rule to handle this: https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/minimizing-bundle-size/#option-one-use-path-imports)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | While optimized for performance, Mantine may have a slightly higher overhead due to its more extensive component library.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Responsiveness             | Provide responsive array and object syntax. All style props accept arrays as values for mobile-first responsive styles. Ex. w={[300, 400, 500]}                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Can be done using array and object syntax, also theme provide five styles helpers: <br>1. theme.breakpoints.up(key)<br>2. theme.breakpoints.down(key) <br>3. theme.breakpoints.only(key)<br>4. theme.breakpoints.not(key) <br>5. theme.breakpoints.between(start, end)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Responsive styles can be added with media queries. This can be configured with mixin while using sass. You need to defined all breakpoints (Note: brakepoints must be same as in your theme) and create needed mixins. While customizing components in theme responsive array or object syntax is not available, so all responsive styles must be defined in scss.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Ease of Use                | Comes with a very intuitive, CSS-like, and prop based model of styling components                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Offers a comprehensive set of components ready to use out of the box, perfect for developers wanting to quickly move projects forward                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | All styling based on css variables witch requires knolege of variable names based on the create theme. Ex <br>`fontSizes:`<br>` {`<br>&nbsp;`xxs: '0.125rem',`<br>`}`<br>`font-size: var(--mantine-font-size-xxs);`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Components Customizability | Theme provide for each component defineStyleConfig function that provides ability to edit: baseStyle, sizes, variants, defaultProps.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Have strict guidelines and rules [hash]-Mui[Component name]-[name of the slot]. Mui have predefined state classes taht are generated for all global classnames: <br>active - .Mui-active<br> checked - .Mui-checked<br> completed - .Mui-completed<br> disabled - .Mui-disabled<br> error - .Mui-error<br> expanded - .Mui-expanded<br> focus visible - .Mui-focusVisible focused - .Mui-focused<br> readOnly - .Mui-readOnly<br> required - .Mui-required<br> selected - .Mui-selected | Components have predefined css variables that can be modified in theme depend on fox example props (variant, size, ...). Not all css variable are defined so to customize deeply you will need to use css file with predefined class system: <br>`1) root -	.mantine-Button-root -	Root element `<br>`2) loader -	.mantine-Button-loader -	Loader component, displayed only when loading prop is set`<br>`3) inner -	.mantine-Button-inner -	Contains all other elements, child of the root element`<br>`4) section -	.mantine-Button-section -	Left and right sections of the button`<br>`5) label -	.mantine-Button-label -	Button children` |
| Typescript                 | By default Chakra do not use ts for customizable props, but all can be types using this instruction: https://chakra-ui.com/docs/styled-system/advanced-theming#theme-typings. The autocomplete for theme token only works in Visual Studio Code. Note 🚨: If you delete the node_modules directory, you'll need to re-run types generator scripts to get proper typings again. | Fully compatible with TypeScript. If ypu want to add new properties (colors, typography, ...) you need override particular interface exported from mui in \*.d.ts file                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Fully compatible with TypeScript. Each @mantine/ package that exports components, exports props types for these components as well. MantineTheme can be extends in \*.d.ts file.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Developers building blogs, personal portfolios, and small business websites often choose Chakra UI for its ease of use and quick setup.                                                                                                                     | Is widely adopted in enterprise applications due to its comprehensive component library .For example, large-scale applications like admin dashboards, CRM systems, and e-commerce platforms                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Server-side Rendering      | **Chakra UI only works in client-side components**, but supports NextJS in client components. [Documentation](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/getting-started/nextjs-app-guide)                                                                                                                                                                                                       | MUI supports server-side rendering. [Documentation](https://mui.com/material-ui/integrations/nextjs/)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | All Mantine components use useContext hook to support default props and Styles API. Mantine components cannot be used as server components. It means that components will render both on the server and client. [Documentation](https://mantine.dev/guides/next/#server-components)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

### Prons and Cons

1. Material-UI (MUI):
   - Pros:
     - Big number of components
     - Comprehensive theming and customization options.
     - Large and active community.
     - Supports server-side rendering.
     - Big icon library
   - Cons:
     - Initial load times may be impacted by the extensive component library.
     - Strict guidelines and rules for customizing components.
     - The packaging sizing of this library can be very high.
     - Customization of components in this library can be really time-consuming and challenging
2. Chakra UI:
   - Pros:
     - Lightweight and performant.
     - Intuitive and easy to use.
     - Responsive array and object syntax.
     - Good documentation and community support.
     - TypeScript support.
   - Cons:
     - Server-side rendering is not supported.
     - Some components not fully customizable.
3. Mantine:
   - Pros:
     - Lightweight and customizable.
     - Growing community and active development.
     - Supports server-side rendering.
   - Cons:
     - Limited responsive styling options.
     - Customization requires knowledge of css variables.
     - Server-side rendering is not supported.
     - No array responsive syntax

### Personal Experience

1. Chakra UI: Very intuitive and easy to use, with a simple and flexible API for styling components. The documentation is well-organized and easy to follow, making it easy to get started with the library. I particularly liked the responsive array and object syntax, which made it easy to create mobile-first responsive styles.
2. Material-UI (MUI): Offers a wide options of components and theming options. It has good but complicate logic of styling components that covers all possible cases. Use to setup and use, has good default theme. Themeing if fully customizable, but requires ts override for new properties.
3. Mantine: On last update Mantine removed sx prop, so most of styling must be done in css file. In css files theme variables can be used with predefined class system (ex. var(--mantine-<variable-name>);), which I found unconvinient. Colors system require to define 10 shades of each color, which is not always needed. All theme properties converted to css variables. All theme properties can be have extra properties, without ts override like in MUI. Do'nt have reapondive array, only object syntax. Values like margins, padding can be set in px, in compoennts props, and they will be converted to rem by default.

### Conclusion

Each UI library has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different types of projects. Chakra UI is ideal for projects requiring a design system based on styled-components with good documentation and community support. MUI is suitable for projects following Material Design principles, with extensive theming and customization options. Mantine is recommended for projects seeking lightweight yet customizable UI components, with a growing community and active development.
Mine personal choice is Chakra UI because of its simplicity and flexibility.
